Guidlines from: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

Guidline one:
Error message presentation.
A redirect to another page in not needed in the user fails to login.
Stay on the same page and just give a pop-up or a notifycation. 
Plus less loading.
Also a pop up alert for caps lock would be nice.

Guidline two:
Eliminate redundancy. 
The forget password should be enough for people to go to if they can't login.
Also place forgot username with/ under the forgot password, for ease of access.
An extra box is not needed.

Guidline three:
Visual simplicity, resizeablity 
Re-position the login window, either just for mibile/ smaller screens or overall.
Make a separate link to a dedicated login page, or enlarge it on the current page.
Because the main reason people go to the site is to login to their portal.
